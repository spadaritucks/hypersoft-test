# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to implement a scalable and maintainable backend architecture for the product management system.

## Decision
Implement Clean Architecture with DDD patterns:
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, ValueObjects, DomainEvents, Services
- **Application Layer**: CQRS with Commands/Queries, Handlers, DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repositories, External Services, Database
- **API Layer**: Controllers, Middlewares, Configuration

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable and maintainable code
- Independent of frameworks and databases
- Follows SOLID principles

### Negative
- More complex initial setup
- More files and folders to manage

## Alternatives Considered
- Simple layered architecture
- Hexagonal architecture
